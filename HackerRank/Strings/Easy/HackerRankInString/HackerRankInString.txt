We say that a string contains the word hackerrank if a subsequence of its characters spell the word hackerrank. Remeber that a subsequence maintains the order of characters selected from a sequence.

For each query, print YES on a new line if the string contains hackerrank, otherwise, print NO.

Example
s = hereiamstackerrank
This contains a subsequence of all of the characters in the proper order. Answer YES


s = haacckkerannk
This is missing the second 'r'. Answer NO.
